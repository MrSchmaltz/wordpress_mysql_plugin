Learn how to create a secure WordPress plugin that connects to a MySQL server with password-protected tables. This guide provides a simplified example, emphasizing the importance of handling credentials securely and implementing proper database connections. Discover best practices for securing sensitive information, utilizing WordPress .
Creating a WordPress plugin involves several steps, and developing one that connects to a MySQL server with password-protected tables requires careful handling of credentials and database connections. Below is a simplified example of a WordPress plugin that retrieves and displays data from the specified MySQL tables.

Please note that handling database credentials in code is a security risk. It’s recommended to use WordPress options or environment variables to store sensitive information. Additionally, you need to consider security practices, error handling, and proper escaping to prevent SQL injection.

Create a new folder for your plugin:
Create a folder in the WordPress plugins directory (e.g., wp-content/plugins/my-mysql-plugin).
Create the main plugin file (my-mysql-plugin.php):

Usage:

Add the shortcode [mysql_data] to any WordPress post or page where you want to display the data.
Remember to replace the placeholder credentials with your actual database details. Ensure that you follow best practices for security, and consider using WordPress options or environment variables for sensitive information. Additionally, handle errors gracefully and sanitize/escape data to prevent security vulnerabilities.

Debugging Output: Add some debugging output to your shortcode function to see if it’s being called and if there are any issues with the database queries. For example:

function display_mysql_data() {
    // ... existing code ...

    // Debugging output
    echo '<pre>';
    var_dump($result); // Check the query result
    echo '</pre>';

    // ... existing code ...
}
